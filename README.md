# Fleet-Management-Dashboard

A fleet management system (FMS) is a comprehensive software and hardware solution used by businesses and organizations to efficiently manage and monitor their fleet of vehicles, assets, or equipment. It encompasses a range of functions and features aimed at improving fleet operations, reducing costs, enhancing safety, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Here are some key components and capabilities of a typical fleet management system:

Vehicle Tracking: FMS uses GPS technology to provide real-time tracking of vehicles' locations. This enables fleet managers to monitor the movement of vehicles, improve route planning, and respond quickly to emergencies.
Telematics Data: The system collects data from onboard sensors and devices, such as vehicle speed, fuel consumption, engine diagnostics, and driver behavior (e.g., speeding, harsh braking). This data helps in optimizing fleet performance and maintenance
Route Optimization: FMS offers tools for optimizing routes, which can reduce fuel consumption, minimize driving time, and improve delivery efficiency.
Maintenance Management: The system schedules and tracks vehicle maintenance based on usage or time intervals. It provides alerts for routine servicing, helping prevent breakdowns and prolonging the lifespan of vehicles.
Driver Behavior Monitoring: FMS tracks and reports on driver behavior, promoting safer driving practices and reducing the risk of accidents. This can include monitoring for speeding, harsh braking, and excessive idling.
